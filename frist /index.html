    <p class="text-block grid-item3">
      Impressionism's rebellion stemmed from rejecting the traditional, state-controlled French art establishment (the Salon) by creating their own independent shows, challenging academic standards with loose brushwork and everyday subjects, and capturing modern life's fleeting moments
    </p>

    <p class="text-block grid-item3">
        Impressionism's impact on modern art is foundational, revolutionizing painting by prioritizing subjective perception, light, and emotion over realism, directly influencing Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Abstract Expressionism, and paving the way for contemporary art's focus on personal expression, diverse perspectives, and new techniques in fields like photography and design, all stemming from its break with tradition and celebration of everyday life.
